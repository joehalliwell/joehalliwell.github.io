          <h1>Eulogy</h1>

          <p>
            In his last few weeks in hospital, my Dad took to greeting me with a
            fist bump. I have no idea where that came from &mdash; it might have
            been an accident the first time &mdash; but we both recognized it as
            something new. He smiled. We enjoyed the absurdity of it. We were
            happy to see each other.
          </p>

          <div class="beat"></div>

          <p>
            As a child, I discovered that I could produce an Adam Ant-inspired
            yodel that would make my Dad block his ears and screw up his face in
            anguish. I can only have been five or six, and I revelled in the
            power it gave me.
          </p>

          <p>
            My dad believed in democracy. He worked as an Electoral Registration
            Officer and used to deliver polling cards on foot. I'd go with him
            to help.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tranmere Park estate was the best beat. There are grand houses there
            in mock tudor and modernist. The letterboxes snapped at my fingers.
          </p>

          <p>
            My dad paid me for helping him. I thought it was just a fair day's
            pay for a fair day's work.
          </p>

          <p>
            My dad supported the miners. We argued about that. I couldn't fathom
            prolonging that grubby business. He saw beyond the coal face.
          </p>

          <div class="beat"></div>

          <p>The only car he ever drove was a sage green Vauxhall cavalier.</p>

          <p>
            When I was small and in the passenger seat we'd sing silly songs:
            "we march to our places, with clean hands faces and pay great
            attention to all we are told; for we know we can never be happy or
            clever, for learning is worth more than silver and gold".
          </p>

          <p>
            That sounds like a hymn to obedience doesn't it? But the two of us
            sang it with wild abandon and a twinkle in the eye.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a teenager I am in the back seat, it is always night and the rain
            is always crackling against the windows. It is always Sunday and he
            is driving us back home from Steph and Jim's, or Margaret and
            Graham's, or our wider family down in Manchester.
          </p>

          <p>
            Like a ship in a storm, the radio crashes through thick waves of
            static, surfacing occasionally as football results. It is too dark
            to read so I listen to the radio and stare at the black moorland and
            sometimes distant city lights deep in the valley.
          </p>

          <p>"Roger!"</p>

          <p>My mum shouts at him occasionally to keep him from nodding off.</p>

          <div class="beat"></div>

          <p>
            Once whilst rifling through his sock drawer looking for something or
            other I found a birthday card I'd made for him. It depicts him as a
            golden-maned lion, which &mdash; if you knew my timid and
            raven-haired dad &mdash; is comically inappropriate.
          </p>

          <p>
            It was a child's idea of what a birthday card for a father ought to
            look like. And even as a child I knew that: I was trying it on for
            size. Or maybe I just wanted to draw a lion.
          </p>

          <p>
            Still, I was surprised &mdash; and pleased &mdash; that he'd kept
            that card with his socks.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the 90s, I rifled through his wardrobe. His least favourite
            clothes became my fashion statements. A kipper tie with a seemingly
            irregular grid of black and white squares like a crossword puzzle. A
            cosy blue corduroy bomber jacket. A jazzy cream shirt with brown
            stripes like a musical stave.
          </p>

          <p>They became mine. I built my style around his.</p>

          <div class="beat"></div>

          <p>
            We both loved puzzles, especially cryptic crosswords. And he was
            good at them.
          </p>

          <p>
            Earlier this year, when we tried to do a puzzle together, he refused
            to believe I could get stuck on anything. He thought I was putting
            it on to make him feel better. "Aww don't play, Joe, don't play" he
            said in his anguished voice.
          </p>

          <p>This time it hurt me too.</p>

          <div class="beat"></div>

          <p>
            These few episodes of anguish aside he seemed quite indifferent to
            my actions and choices.
          </p>

          <p>I wouldn't have had it any other way.</p>

          <p>I have always felt free to draw a lion if I want to.</p>

          <p>Fist bump, Dad.</p>
